⚙️ My Learning Journey — Building Like Stark

About Me:
Hi, I’m Benedict Dela, 18 years old — a self-taught learner on a mission to understand the science and logic behind technology.
I began with Python programming to sharpen my problem-solving skills and develop the mindset of a true creator — the kind who doesn’t just use technology but builds it.

Current Focus:

Core Python (loops, conditionals, lists)

Logical thinking and automation

Combining programming with creativity and innovation

Timeline:

Start Date: October 2025

Current Stage: For Loops

Next Goal: If Statements and Conditional Logic

Long-Term Vision: To combine coding, AI, and engineering — creating systems that make life smarter, faster, and more efficient.

Challenge Log:

Sum of 5 numbers using a for loop — Oct 28, 2025

Counting even and odd numbers — Oct 29, 2025

Multiplication table generator — Oct 29, 2025

Finding the average of numbers in a list — Oct 30, 2025

Finding the largest and smallest number in a list — Oct 30, 2025

Next Steps:

Master conditionals and functions

Learn how logic drives automation

Begin experimenting with small apps and tools
